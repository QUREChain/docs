# QURE Chain Introduction

What part of science isn’t broken?  Profits drive research; if a cure isn’t profitable for a multinational, it doesn’t get the R\&D.  Patients, caregivers, and researchers are at the mercy of a geopolitical, economic system that disincentives the very behavior that everyone wants to incentivize – speeding cures to patients.  [QURE Chain](https://www.qurechain.com) is a new paradigm needed to fix science that gives patients and researchers a voice - but choices in how cures are researched and developed:  A voice and a choice in the end-to-end process of developing any cure.

[QURE Chain](https://www.qurechain.com) empowers post-clinical and post-development activities beyond the R\&D and discovery process. Because all the data and intelligence are already provided, the manufacturing and distribution activities of the cures developed on the platform will be enabled. The blockchain's composability gives rise to higher-level applications further down the pipeline, such as scale-up manufacturing and supply chain management.

A wave of concern regarding the reproducibility of pre-clinical studies has swept across the life science domain, with an unsettling volume of pre-clinical studies identified as irreproducible \[1,2]. This “Reproducibility Crisis” fuels unwarranted optimism among patients and unveils glaring inefficiencies in the execution, design, and disclosure of pre-clinical investigations. This crisis is further underlined by emerging questions surrounding the efficacy of the current peer-review mechanism itself \[3]. The emergence of Post-Publication Peer Scrutiny Platforms, data dissemination, and open-access publishing provides a fresh lens to identify irreproducible research \[4].

By providing an environment that fosters the development of a decentralized peer-review platform, QURE will first embark upon its mission to create an incentivized Layer-1 blockchain solution and then to attract existing DAOs and decentralized science applications and communities to the platform with these economic incentives and superior technology options.

QURE Is The Solution

At **QURE Chain**, we foster a culture of transparency and trust by establishing a reproducibility-centric reputation system for scientists while promoting collaboration across academic, industrial, and governmental sectors. We are inviting you to become part of this movement toward redefining the paradigms of decentralized research through $QURE.

By leveraging [**QURE XR**](https://www.qurexr.com), we’re not just spectators; we’re stepping into the future of life sciences research with our pioneering XR Platform and AI systems. QURE Chain is a conduit for enhanced scientist performance, incentivization, data sharing, and collaborative endeavors.
